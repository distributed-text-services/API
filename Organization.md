# Organization

Currently, the Distributed Text Services is not legally formalized as an organization (outside of the Github Organization and the Google Group).

Although, the Distributed Text Services specifications is lead by a [Technical Committee](#technical_committee). It is responsible for the evolution and documentation of the specifications.


## Technical Committee

* The **Technical committee** is responsible for voting on feature requests and bugs
* Once the initial committee is established, the committee itself is responsible for approving new members to the committee
*  New feature requests must be voted on by the technical committee in order to be approved as additions to the spec.
* Committee members have 1 month after a feature request is officially opened for voting to provide their vote.  If you don't vote within that time frame, it is the same as voting yes. The exception is feature requests opened for voting in July and August. The voting period for these is extended to 2 months.
* Decisions are normally made by consensus.  If there is need for a vote, the chair
is responsible for determining a fair process and ensuring adequately informed
discussion ahead of time.
* Consensus means that there is adequate representation, nobody cannot live with
the decision, and there is general approval for the decision.

## Roles

### Technical Committee Member

* attends at least 1/2 of the regular teleconferences
* is responsible for voting on new feature requests and bugs

### Ambassador

## Minutes of meetings

Technical committee minutes can be found at [github.com/distributed-text-services/meeting-notes](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/meeting-notes)


## Specific situations

### *Question:* What about excused absences?

Recorded.  If it ever comes to a question of whether someone should be kicked off, we can decide how to take it into account.

### *Question:* How flexible are we on dates?

If a member of the technical committee can't make it, we can negotiate dates.

### *Question:* What happens if there is no consensus ?

If consensus cannot be reached in a meeting, we will generally postpone the decision pending further discussion. If we find ourselves unable to reach a decision on an important issue, the chair will work with participants or appoint someone else to work with participants beyond meeting time to try to find agreement. If we simply cannot reach a decision, the group needs to decide how to proceed.

#### *Question:* What about conflict of interest with the chair, when the chair has a strong opinion?

* Group members can always say they believe the chair should recuse for a decision or other activity
* Group members can ask chair to be excessively clear whether operating as a member or chairing

### *Question:* what is the process for officially opening the voting period for a feature or bug request

(i.e. does the clock start when the item is submitted, is there a formal triage process, etc.)

* In general, anything at all complicated should be submitted at least 1 week before a meeting that decides on it.
* If there is consensus to make a decision in a meeting, we can decide
